# brainfrix
The Brainfuck specific GUI and interpreter. 
Documentation v.0.1
#PRE-ALPHA STAGE
Ivan Patarčić & Filip Jerleković, 2020

We have no rights, but if we had we would reserve them.

The BrainFrick language is simply an extension of the Brainfuck language, adding 11 new commands.
The 11 new commands can be seen and learned through the BrainFrick handbook, writ by us. 
To run the BrainFrix program simply run gui.py, having python installed as a prerequisite. 

If you do not have python installed, install python at
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The BrainFrix program features a Python Tkinter GUI and a C++ interpreter. The program was made
because we, as people who often code in Brainfuck needed a bit more advanced language and wanted a GUI.

The current version (-1.0.2) has a text entry box for the code and a small entry for the code input.
This is just a proof of concept program. The final program will hopefully have the following:
-A file open and save function, along with a file browser
-A cell preview while the program is running
-An option menu including the following:
  -Brainfuck or BrainFrick mode
  -GUI options
  -TimeOut set
  
For now the complete package also includes a config.txt, which currently has only one option, the program
timeout limit.
